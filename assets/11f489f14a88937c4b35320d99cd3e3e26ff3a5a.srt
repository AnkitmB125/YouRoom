1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,548
<i>My name&#39;s Ketchup</i>

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,133
<i>And my name is Mustard</i>

3
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:11,094
<i>Together, we&#39;re Ketchup and Mustard</i>

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,067
Cut.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,445
I have seen into the future.

6
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,947
And I have seen
that today is a new day!

7
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,992
A day... full of girls.

8
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,787
Yeah!

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,289
Yeah!

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,206
Action.

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,083
I just wish...

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,334
I just...

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,919
I just wish...

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,130
Line.

15
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,840
Russians? What...?

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,178
Yeah. Oh.

17
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,846
You lie. Sorry.

18
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,600
Alright, then. I&#39;ll use my torch
to set fire to the chamber... cham...

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,976
I got this one.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,437
Alright, then. I&#39;ll use my torts...

21
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,855
Alright, then.

22
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,775
Alright, then. I&#39;ll use my torch to...
You alright?

23
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,943
-Yeah, sorry.
-I know, it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s hard.

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,446
...frequency band to relay...

25
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,364
I love how I get it right
when we rehearse

26
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,200
-and then we shoot...
-Oh, motherfucker.

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,370
I don&#39;t know my line...

28
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,247
-Oh, it was so good for the camera!
-I know.

29
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,416
-I know.
-Okay. What is his line?

30
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,417
No!

31
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,087
That&#39;s totally against the rules!

32
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,380
Did you just...?

33
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,550
I&#39;m sorry.

34
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,968
Sorry.

35
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,559
-Let&#39;s do it again. Alright.
-Yeah.

36
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,609
Go!

37
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,821
Your mom called.

38
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,615
She needs you home right away.

39
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,699
Is everything okay?

40
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,117
No, I don&#39;t think so.

41
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,577
It&#39;s your grandma.

42
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,120
That&#39;s...

43
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,581
It&#39;s your grandma.

44
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,292
Yeah!

45
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,379
No. No, I don&#39;t think so.

46
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,508
-Such a crazy season.
-Okay.

47
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,592
-Ready? You got this.
-Okay.

48
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,219
It&#39;s your grandma.

49
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,806
-What&#39;s wrong with you?
-I don&#39;t know.

50
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,057
It&#39;s your grandma.

51
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,311
-That word is so funny!
-I can&#39;t...

52
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,729
I can&#39;t do this.

53
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,314
Yeah, I liked that one, too.

54
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,870
I can... do it!

55
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,374
Is this a rehearsal or are we rolling?

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,793
Hell yeah. Hi, editors.

57
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,880
Priah.

58
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,922
Oh, I&#39;m sorry.

59
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,426
-Push harder!
-I&#39;m in here.

60
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,011
I can fit!

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,937
What&#39;s wrong?

62
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:14,944
Hey, there!

63
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,362
We&#39;re having an issue.

64
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,115
Now doesn&#39;t that look just...?

65
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,202
Oh, I&#39;m so sorry.

66
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,288
Sorry, the... the bottom came off.

67
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,498
It happened again, it just literally...

68
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,666
-I&#39;m so sorry, guys.
-Ready?

69
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
One, two, three. And...

70
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,090
I have to go home.

71
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,467
Oh! Sorry!

72
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,968
What was that?

73
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,137
It&#39;s your grandma.

74
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,597
What?

75
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,724
Yeah!

76
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,767
Uh, David?
