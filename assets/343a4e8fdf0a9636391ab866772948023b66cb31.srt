1
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,076
There is nothing bigger
or older than the universe.

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,588
The questions
I would like to talk about are:

3
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:28,898
one, where did we come from?

4
00:00:29,977 --> 00:00:32,413
How did the universe come into being?

5
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,136
Are we alone in the universe?

6
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,304
Is there alien life out there?

7
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,773
What is the future of the human race?

8
00:00:43,606 --> 00:00:46,136
Up until the 1920s,

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,136
everyone thought the universe
was essentially static

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,136
and unchanging in time.

11
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:55,815
Then it was discovered
that the universe was expanding.

12
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,989
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.

13
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:05,413
This meant they must have been
closer together in the past.

14
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:08,516
If we extrapolate back,

15
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,136
we find we must have
all been on top of each other

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,682
about 15 billion years ago.

17
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:19,547
This was the Big Bang,
the beginning of the universe.

18
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,572
But was there anything
before the Big Bang?

19
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:27,460
If not, what created the universe?

20
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:32,874
Why did the universe emerge
from the Big Bang the way it did?

21
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,136
We used to think
that the theory of the universe

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,620
could be divided into two parts.

23
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,136
First, there were the laws

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,824
like Maxwell&#39;s equations
and general relativity

25
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:48,813
that determined the evolution
of the universe,

26
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:52,135
given its state
over all of space at one time.

27
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:58,136
And second, there was no question
of the initial state of the universe.

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,136
We have made good progress
on the first part,

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,136
and now have the knowledge
of the laws of evolution

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,136
in all but the most extreme conditions.

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,136
But until recently,
we have had little idea

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,286
about the initial conditions
for the universe.

33
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:21,826
However, this division into laws
of evolution and initial conditions

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,771
depends on time and space
being separate and distinct.

35
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:31,635
Under extreme conditions,
general relativity and quantum theory

36
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,160
allow time to behave
like another dimension of space.

37
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:43,359
This removes the distinction
between time and space,

38
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:48,506
and means the laws of evolution
can also determine the initial state.

39
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,506
The universe can spontaneously
create itself out of nothing.

40
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:03,136
Moreover, we can calculate
a probability that the universe

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,560
was created in different states.

42
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,922
These predictions
are in excellent agreement

43
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:15,118
with observations by the WMAP satellite
of the cosmic microwave background,

44
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:18,136
which is an imprint
of the very early universe.

45
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,160
We think we have solved
the mystery of creation.

46
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,928
Maybe we should patent the universe

47
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:30,404
and charge everyone royalties
for their existence.

48
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:36,514
I now turn to the second big question:

49
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:40,160
are we alone, or is there
other life in the universe?

50
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,825
We believe that life arose
spontaneously on the Earth,

51
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,699
so it must be possible for life
to appear on other suitable planets,

52
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,317
of which there seem to be
a large number in the galaxy.

53
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,685
But we don&#39;t know how life first appeared.

54
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:07,136
We have two pieces
of observational evidence

55
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,160
on the probability of life appearing.

56
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:18,160
The first is that we have fossils of algae
from 3.5 billion years ago.

57
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,316
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago

58
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,828
and was probably too hot
for about the first half billion years.

59
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,415
So life appeared on Earth

60
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,091
within half a billion years
of it being possible,

61
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:42,791
which is short compared
to the 10-billion-year lifetime

62
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,433
of a planet of Earth type.

63
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:50,275
This suggests that the probability
of life appearing is reasonably high.

64
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:54,654
If it was very low,
one would have expected it

65
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:58,136
to take most
of the ten billion years available.

66
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,890
On the other hand, we don&#39;t seem
to have been visited by aliens.

67
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,731
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.

68
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:12,034
Why would they appear
only to cranks and weirdos?

69
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:18,702
If there is a government conspiracy
to suppress the reports

70
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:23,136
and keep for itself the scientific
knowledge the aliens bring,

71
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,556
it seems to have been a singularly
ineffective policy so far.

72
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:37,136
Furthermore, despite an extensive search
by the SETI project,

73
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,136
we haven&#39;t heard any alien
television quiz shows.

74
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:46,581
This probably indicates
that there are no alien civilizations

75
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:48,851
at our stage of development

76
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,160
within a radius
of a few hundred light years.

77
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,136
Issuing an insurance policy

78
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,833
against abduction by aliens
seems a pretty safe bet.

79
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,555
This brings me to the last
of the big questions:

80
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,705
the future of the human race.

81
00:06:08,821 --> 00:06:12,480
If we are the only intelligent
beings in the galaxy,

82
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,789
we should make sure
we survive and continue.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,380
But we are entering an increasingly
dangerous period of our history.

84
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:32,958
Our population and our use
of the finite resources of planet Earth

85
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,054
are growing exponentially,

86
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:40,077
along with our technical ability
to change the environment for good or ill.

87
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,615
But our genetic code

88
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,646
still carries the selfish
and aggressive instincts

89
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,750
that were of survival
advantage in the past.

90
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:00,112
It will be difficult enough
to avoid disaster

91
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,852
in the next hundred years,

92
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:04,399
let alone the next thousand or million.

93
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:11,778
Our only chance of long-term survival

94
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:15,136
is not to remain inward-looking
on planet Earth,

95
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,388
but to spread out into space.

96
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,580
The answers to these big questions

97
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:27,376
show that we have made remarkable progress
in the last hundred years.

98
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:32,479
But if we want to continue
beyond the next hundred years,

99
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,666
our future is in space.

100
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,136
That is why I am in favor of manned --

101
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,873
or should I say, 
personned -- space flight.

102
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:52,136
All of my life I have sought
to understand the universe

103
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,649
and find answers to these questions.

104
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:57,498
I have been very lucky

105
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:01,579
that my disability has not been
a serious handicap.

106
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:06,242
Indeed, it has probably given me
more time than most people

107
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,536
to pursue the quest for knowledge.

108
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:16,136
The ultimate goal is a complete
theory of the universe,

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,414
and we are making good progress.

110
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
Thank you for listening.

111
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,974
Chris Anderson: Professor,
if you had to guess either way,

112
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:33,804
do you now believe
that it is more likely than not

113
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:37,146
that we are alone in the Milky Way,

114
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:42,873
as a civilization of our level
of intelligence or higher?

115
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,136
This answer took seven minutes,
and really gave me an insight

116
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,212
into the incredible act of generosity
this whole talk was for TED.

117
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:23,136
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely
that we are the only civilization

118
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,495
within several hundred light years;

119
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,932
otherwise we would have heard radio waves.

120
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:37,112
The alternative is that civilizations
don&#39;t last very long,

121
00:09:37,136 --> 00:09:39,297
but destroy themselves.

122
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,136
CA: Professor Hawking,
thank you for that answer.

123
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,109
We will take it
as a salutary warning, I think,

124
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,423
for the rest of our conference this week.

125
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:54,427
Professor, we really thank you
for the extraordinary effort you made

126
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,364
to share your questions with us today.

127
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,040
Thank you very much indeed.

128
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,876
(Applause)
